My website experiment.

At present this is just a quick Bootstrap template.  
I'm using Bootstrap over something like Angular because you don't even need a brain to start with it (I mean that as a compliment) and I don't care much for web development. (no offense to web people)

I don't know what I want the end product to look like as of writing this so it will probably take longer than it needs to.

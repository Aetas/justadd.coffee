My website experiment.

At present this is just a quick Bootstrap template.  
I'm using Bootstrap over something like Angular because you don't even need a brain to start with it (I mean that as a compliment) and I don't care much for web development. (no offense to web people)

I don't know what I want the end product to look like as of writing this so it will probably take longer than it needs to.

Yeah, I need to do a lot of research on how to categorize pages/elements in Bootstrap. The whole "do it right the first time" thing is probably the worst when it comes to coding. Still important but to a point.

So much CSS in every flavor. This was also originally made for one page sites, unlike what I'm doing with it.

## Next up:
Convert to multi-page layout. Might actually switch to a different layout in general. Probs a better idea. I'd need to learn Jekyll or Ghost or some such though.  
Which would be both easier and more boring.

Yeah, I don't think I'm going to do Ghost/etc. No blog-like layout (who needs interaction anyway?) but a portfolio-style post.

Update:  
Looks like I might just go with Drupal. It's going to take a bit of reading-up though. I'm itching to do Trusty Rusty Rows as well.

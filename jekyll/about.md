# I should probably put things here  
Like right here.

I'm Derek. Electrical & Computer Engineering Student at CU Boulder. This is one of my pet projects I took on in my spare time out of interest and curiosity. Turns out I don't care much for \'front end\' development, though I have a much greater respect for people who work in it. Felt like all I was doing was juggling other people's work and trying to make them play nice. Fortunately, Jekyll came to my rescue.

Among other things, I rather enjoy music, [brews](../brews/index.html), and[books](../books/index.html) when I find the time.

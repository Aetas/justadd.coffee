# I should probably put things here  
Like right here.

I'm Derek. Electrical & Computer Engineering Student at CU Boulder. This is one of my pet projects I took on in my spare time out of interest and curiosity. Turns out I don't care much for \'front end\' development, though I have a much greater respect for people who work in it. Felt like all I was doing was juggling other people's work and trying to make them play nice. Fortunately, Jekyll came to my rescue.

Among other things, I rather enjoy music, [brews](../brews/index.html), and[books](../books/index.html) when I find the time.  
I have a bad habit of picking up more projects than I have time for and taking forever to complete them (I also blame a lack of funds). Coincidentally, I also have a bad habit of throwing two b's in habit.

Though I thoroughly enjoy playing with electronics, I find myself programming more than anything. Primarily due to the fact that programming requires but a computer and your choice of compiler/editor and electronics testing equipment can get rather pricey.

I also keep an old \'84 CJ-7 around as somewhat of a project car. Jeeps, particularly old ones, are like grown-up Legos. Very very expensive Legos. In fact, if you took a bunch of Legos, built a pit, and threw money into it, that would be an accurate representation of an old Jeep.

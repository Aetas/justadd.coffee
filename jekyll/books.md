Get a sick bookshelf header image, stat! Everybody loves bookshelves.

# Good ol' Books.

\<stupid quote\>
- Thanks mom

Put books here? (Running list, maybe comment on recent ones as I finish them)

* Alastair Reynolds
* Michael Crichton (Sphere, Alaska)
* China Mi√©ville
* Boys in the Boat
* Water for Elephantes
* Ancillary Justice
* The Martian
* Harry Pothead
* who knows. I'll get to it.

This page won't have a link anywhere on the site unless I explicitly link it in an article. Or aboutme.

Maybe I should do the same for gramps.

I kinda like the idea of having a bunch of unlinked pages that can only be chanced upon.  
Maybe I should add a music section.

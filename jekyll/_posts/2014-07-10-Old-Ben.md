This is Old Benjamin or Old Ben. Like the clock. But better.

### Fun Tidbits About Old Ben
He's got a ~'94 4.0L HO from a YJ in the front with a lot of wires to boot. Due to the switch from carbureted to electronic injection while retaining the old fuel tank assembly, Old Ben has a bit of a whine from an external fuel pump. He's just excited for the drive, really. Plus, he passes emission tests because of this so there's no need to disable a cylinder like you had to with the 258. [^1]

There's a trussed Dana 44 in the rear and a Dana 30 up front, both with 4.11 gearing and ARB air lockers. They're pretty pieces of equipment with their disc brakes and 33" T/A KO2's. Lets just not talk about the parking brake (drum-in-hat) being so rusted that the old owner stretched out the previous e-brake cable.

He's also got power steering and a York 210 air compressor that I'm turning into onboard air. Since '84 was the best CJ year hands down, it had the wide-track set and pre-drilled holes in the firewall for a brake booster. Of which I promptly made use of and strapped a double-diaphragm (diaphragm. What a word) booster on.

Inside is a \'full\' roll cage - meaning it runs up front along the window and down to the wheel wells but it's nothing fancy. The original owners had intended to fill the front tube with compressed air but I rather dislike the idea of ~90-120 psi around my head. It's like storing a 10 foot long pipe bomb around your head while furiously detonating dinosaur remains up front. In shot; business in the front, party in the back.  
There you have it, storing compressed air around your head is equivalent to wearing a mullet. With pride.

There's also a new-old stereo system & tuffy box but they're trash so not really worth mentioning. I'd like to use an Intel Edison or R-Pi to make a new sound system but I'll have to get fancy with the amplifiers. Which sounds like a lot of fun, honestly.

I'd like to repaint the old lad but that's super expensive and not something I should take on myself (the internal bedliner is another story). I also need to take care of any rust before sealing it in.

### Hand Throttle  
\<One large image up top, two smaller images below?\>

[^1]: The most hilarious thing about this, in my opinion, is that VW spent (I can only assume) a gratuitous amount of time and brain power to, brilliantly, trick the emissions tests and these old salts who work on Jeeps just disconnect a spark plug and go "Oh yeah, she's got a wee bit o' stage fright in her idle." and smile benignly. Honestly though, who on earth thinks VW is the only company doing this?

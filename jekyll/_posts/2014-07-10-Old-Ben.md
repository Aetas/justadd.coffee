# Introducing Old Ben

Ben is bae.

Old Ben. Like the clock. But better.

Maybe I should have links to all the project write-ups at the end of this post? Might be good. I could also make a gallery-like module so the whole thing doesn;t have to load. Probably just a picture and links though.

## Projects!

<section id="table-of-contents" class="toc">
  <header>
    <h3 >Contents</h3>
  </header>
<div id="drawer" markdown="1">
*  Auto generated table of contents
{:toc}
</div>
</section><!-- /#table-of-contents -->

<!-- Does this generate the whole documents or just below? -->

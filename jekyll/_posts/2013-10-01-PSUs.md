## 5V Power Supply
This power supply was made to support the 5V TTL of the [clock]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2013-12-01-freshman-projects-clock %}) I built for a class. It only supplies 5W of power but that is only because it's all I needed at the time and I didn't have to worry about a 5V/1A regulator burning itself out.

The construction was very simple with a transformer down-converting wall AC and then passing through a full-wave rectifier. That is then flattened over large electrolytic capacitors and passed into the fixed voltage regulator. On the output of that is some smaller capacitors to lower output impedance and to help with switching power draws.

## Variable power supply
The variable power supply was the natural successor to the fixed TTL voltage PSU as I could make it a much higher power and also supply variable voltage over a greater range. I also switched to a PCB so I could shrink the design and use it as an excuse to learn an EDA tool (Eagle in this case).

This power supply was designed to be an output-filtered transformer (for cheap power and center tap) tuned with coarse and fine trim pots mounted to the exterior of the enclosure to set the voltage from the `LM337` and the `LM317`. The variation was intended to center around 12V but extend over 20V and below 5V and use heatsinks on the package to allow for that.

As it was my first Eagle and PCB project I ever undertook, the design has lots of room for improvement -- primarily in the ground/power plane and SMD fronts.

Ultimately I never made this after building a component list and seeing that it cost more than an entry-level PSU while weighing and looking like a brick with knobs. Supplanting a power supply on the long list of future projects is a high-frequency function generator. Much more interesting.

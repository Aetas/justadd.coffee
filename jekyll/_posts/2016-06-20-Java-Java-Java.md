Brews!

 - espresso
 - Boxcar
 - George of the jungle
 - Pesado 58.5 skateboard deck tamper
 - scale?

Include beer? Probs not worth two posts. I mean, honestly. How on earth would I fill **two** posts on coffee and beer?  
Actually that wouldn't be too hard.

Maybe I should just add a section to random posts about excellent beer/coffee/food from the week. Could work. I live in Boulder after all, everyone already thinks I'm a filthy hipster like enjoying good food is a fucking crime. Go eat your McDonalds.

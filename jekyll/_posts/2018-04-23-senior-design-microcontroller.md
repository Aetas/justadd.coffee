## Senior Design Microcontroller Board
This PCB was designed as the main interface to all the sensors and drivers for my [senior design project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url  2017-10-01-Senior-Design %}). The board was designed to support a MSP432 microcontroller (MCU) with a footprint compatible with the mounting posts on a Raspberry Pi and support UART over USB to accept control and telemetry request commands.

The largest problem that arose was the two-layer restriction on the board that came from cost and design tools available (I was using the free Eagle 7.7 edition with only 2 layers available â€“ I didn't know PADs/KiCAD/Altium/etc at that point). As such the board is pretty point-to-point in terms of layout with minimal considerations for return paths and inductive loops.

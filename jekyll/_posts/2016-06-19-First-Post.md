# For my first trick...

I shall test pygments!

```c++
#include<iostream>

using std::cout;

volatile unsigned int ranga;

int main() {
  // do things!
  return 0;
}
```

Did I do a thing?[^1]  
I did. Now does Rust work?

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```  
Nope.

Looks like I'm going to have to uninstall graphics drivers and install them via cuda next... Why is that such a pain in the ass?[^2]

Also, I really have to get rid of that description font. (I have since learned it's called \'Sacramento\' If you're wondering. It was pretty terrible.)

[^1]: I want to try this thing. Looks cooooool.
[^2]: Don't answer that.

I'll probably leave this post as a test ground and a memento for being the first post I ever made.

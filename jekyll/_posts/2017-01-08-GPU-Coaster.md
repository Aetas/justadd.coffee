Circuit boards are rather pretty. Especially when they're in a good color and hold many fancy things.

My mother wanted me to take apart her old all-in-one Mac (it was a 2006, I believe) to get the HDD out so she could recycle the rest.  
Naturally I couldn't just stop there and took the whole thing apart.

I'll give Mac one thing, they do assemble things to a very high standard of quality with zero hope of repairs. They has all sorts of fancy anti-static tape and custom fittings and foam pads and seals and gorgeous copper heat sinks and generally high-quality components. I don't know how anyone would be expected to repair anything save the hard drive but that's not for me to wonder. Fortunately.  

Anyhow, this desktop was from the the good ol' days of Mac when they included nice nvidia GPUs in their computers and this one was no different. It had a nearly perfectly square graphics card with the GPU centered in the memory modules. It's useless to me as a graphics card but it's perfect for a coffee coaster. Well, nearly. It needs some sort of pourable acrylic or similar.

So now I need to create a cast for the card that allows for it to float in the center **and** put a port on the top that I can vacuum pump out the air bubbles with. So 3D printing will probably be involved. After it is cast, I'll sand and polish it to perfection.

The main issue, at the moment, is ensuring the card gets suspended in the solution. I could do an initial pour, let it get semi-cured, and then stick in the card. Or I could use thin pins and just accept the blemishes. Or do a two-part casting.

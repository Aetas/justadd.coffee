# Ready Player One

As with most language/framework choices, when choosing one for the first time I moved between at least 5 frameworks before landing on Jekyll. What a choice. What good are those other unwieldy garbage heaps good for? Just kidding, Jekyll was probably not that great pre-html5. As in, it needed all the plugins in the world to be fully functional. Though our expectations for web pages have also grown with the new HTML standards...

Where to begin...

I started learning html and css back in 2012/2013 before I moved to New York on a whim (my sister's whim to be exact). The good ol' [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) days. At that point I thought I would be making a very simple website that pretty much listed better ways to reach me. Pretty useless, right? Yeah, it didn't make a whole lot of sense. Nobody should ever go through creating a website out of pure html/css files. Well, maybe once.

After that beat the motivation out of me (mind you, I did make one. It was just trash.) I started looking into things like Wordpress. Who's surprised? Nobody. Wordpress is as great as it is boring. More than that, I was just learning programming in c++ and the idea of a heavy \'don't worry about it\' wordpress installation bored me greatly. There was also the slight problem of Wordpress being a cash cow for many hosts. They'll sell you anything for arbitrary amounts (who buys scripts??) because they can get away with it.

search for a blog-like platform that isn't a blog. Bootsrapt themes -> drupal -> jekyll.

Day[9] about just fucking doing it. Maybe a full Ruminate post.

Don't make more posts without finishing the previous ones, Derek.  
^ Too late.

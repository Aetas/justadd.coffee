# [This is my lovely hash-map.](https://github.com/Aetas/Prince-CSCI2270-FinalProject)

I rather enjoyed making it, though as with most things I wanted to go overboard with fancy programming before checking if I could actually do it.

I still did it, I just couldn't use templated classes to nest hash tables within each other. Which would have been awesome.

this and that. I did a thing. I have only a little intention to go back and update it.

I'm still mildly salty nobody tried to contribute to it after I spent so much time on documentation and Makefiles for whatever compilers their little hearts desired.

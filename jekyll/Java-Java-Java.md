Brews!

 - espresso
 - Boxcar
 - George of the jungle
 - Pesado 58.5 skateboard deck tamper
 - scale?

Include beer? Probs not worth two posts. I mean, honestly. How on earth would I fill **two** posts on coffee and beer?  
Actually that wouldn't be too hard.

Maybe I should just add a section to random posts about excellent beer/coffee/food from the week. Could work. I live in Boulder after all, everyone already thinks I'm a filthy hipster like enjoying good food is a fucking crime. Go eat your McDonalds.

Moved to it's own section.

I might consider doing an index page for each broad category that just links the categories page. Maybe a redirect to categories...

## Java
Atom likes to try to autocomplete \'Java\' into \'javascript\' as if I would let such an abomination happen.

### Boxcar Coffee Roasters - Stella Espresso Blend

MY LOVE

### Pinon Coffee
I don't think I'd actually recommend this to most people but it has a special place in my heart for getting me through that tough-love phase of drinking coffee. You know, like the beautiful first moments of a relationship. Except you hated it. Yeah, me and coffee have come a long way.

## Brews

### Port Brewing - Hop-15
Now - as with most beers past your first - I don't entirely trust my opinion of this beer.  
Moving on, when I had this beer I didn't even know beers could taste like that. This was also almost two years ago so I can hardly remember all the over-the-top adjectives I could stuff in here to describe it. It's seasonal and short-lived so I have yet to find it again. It's also only sold in bombers... Reminded me of a LaCumbre Elevated. A bit stronger and more conservatively balanced.

### Stone Brewing - Xocoveza
If you ever run into a particular set of my friends, they'll regale you the story of how I collectively lost my shit when I stumbled on this beer in the wild in the middle of June.

## Whiskey
The debate over the correct spelling of whisky/whiskey should have died when people discovered *whiskey* is *key* to a good drink.

### High West Whiskey - Double Rye
What I'm currently mulling over (as of 2016-06-24) simply because I could not bring myself to buy the better sibling, Rendevous Rye. Which was absolutely spectacular. I also drank quite a bit of it with my father over ~17 days on a river trip on the Grand.

## Java
Atom likes to try to autocomplete \'Java\' into \'javascript\' as if I would let such an abomination happen.

### Boxcar Coffee Roasters - Stella Espresso Blend
The classic.

### Boxcar Coffee Roasters - Whiskeygrin
MY LOVE

### Pinon Coffee
I don't think I'd actually recommend this to most people but it has a special place in my heart for getting me through that tough-love phase of drinking coffee. You know, like the beautiful first moments of a relationship. Except you hated it. Yeah, me and coffee have come a long way.

## Brews

### Port Brewing - Hop-15
Now - as with most beers past your first - I don't entirely trust my opinion of this beer.  
Moving on, when I had this beer I didn't even know beers could taste like that. This was also almost two years ago so I can hardly remember all the over-the-top adjectives I could stuff in here to describe it. It's seasonal and short-lived so I have yet to find it again. It's also only sold in bombers... Reminded me of a LaCumbre Elevated. A bit stronger and more conservatively balanced.

### Stone Brewing - Xocoveza
If you ever run into a particular set of my friends, they'll regale you the story of how I collectively lost my shit when I stumbled on this beer in the wild in the middle of June.

### LaCumbre Brewing - Elevated
Special mentions; project dank, red ryot.

### Marble Brewing - Marble Red
The perfect beer. Oh wait, it gives insane hangovers from a whiff.

## Whiskey
The debate over the correct spelling of whisky/whiskey should have died when people discovered the *key* to a good drink is whis*key*.

### High West Whiskey - Double Rye
What I'm currently mulling over (as of 2016-06-24) simply because I could not bring myself to buy the better sibling, Rendevous Rye. Which was absolutely spectacular. I also drank quite a bit of it with my father over ~17 days on a river trip on the Grand.

I should probably keep track of these things somewhere...

## Misc
- Remove Sacramento font.
  - (Replace with something less horrendous.)
- Possibly make a redirect for /:category/index.html -> /categories/index.html or tags. Or whatever.
- Header images
- webm gifs of projects
  - Liquid video function Maybe
  - Also, ffmpeg quick program
    - LUA?
- So it turns out that the icon I'm using is a Seattle Coffee Gear icon. I don't know how I didn't notice that before. I should probs change that.

## Pages
(All of them)

Finish:  
- about.md
- documentation.md
  - Should I even have this? I'm not making a theme. Could just link to git. I like the book icon.
